# Tech Blog

## Description
 - The backend for a tech blog project allows users to create accounts with secure passwords that are hashed and stored for security purposes. Users can post blogs and view all posts created by other users. In addition, each user has access to their dashboard where they can see comments on their posts. The system automatically logs off inactive users to enhance security, and such users will need to re-login to access the system again.

## Usage
 - Upon visiting the application, users are presented with a main page containing a home, dashboard, and login button, as well as a list of recent blog posts by users. Clicking on a blog's title directs users to the blog's site along with any comments related to that post. Clicking the login button allows users to either log in or sign up for the site. Once logged in, users can visit any blog post and post comments specific to that post. Users also have the ability to update or delete their comments after posting. By navigating to the dashboard, users can post new blogs as well as view existing blogs they've posted. Clicking on the title of an existing blog allows users to update or delete that blog.
